- Rack power density is scaling because of AI
    - This is also why blade servers are useful; the increase power density in a rack by just allowing for more physical servers
- Scott says industry standard design practices incorporate the worst-case environmental conditions anticipated over a 20-year period. For example, if an extreme heat and humidity event occurred 15 years prior, that becomes a design benchmark. It was 120 and humid 15 years ago Scott says? Thatâ€™s your worst case design condition now.
- Water-Cooled Servers: These systems often have specified forward and return water temperatures for the server racks, providing a more predictable heat exchange.
    - water cooled systems need fresh water as salinated water corrodes cooling systems.
    - water cooled systems often lack the same standardization as air cooled systems
- Air-Cooled Servers: The number of chillers required for air-cooled systems is highly dependent on external ambient conditions. This makes their capacity more variable based on the weather.
