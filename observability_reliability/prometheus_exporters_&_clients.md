# Exporters & Clients
This will cover the basics of instrumenting your own system, instrumentation on third party systems, and  how to export the data to prometheus.

Before you can monitor your services, you need to add instrumentation to their code via one of the Prometheus client libraries. When Prometheus scrapes your instance's HTTP endpoint, the client library sends the current state of all tracked metrics to the server.

## Prometheus instrumentation opinions/guidelines

For monitoring purposes, services can generally be broken down into three types: online-serving, offline-processing, and batch jobs. There is overlap between them, but every service tends to fit well into one of these categories.

### Online-serving

An online-serving system is one where a human or another system is expecting an immediate response. For example, most database and HTTP requests fall into this category.

The key metrics in such a system are the number of performed queries, errors, and latency. The number of in-progress requests can also be useful.

### Offline-processing

For offline processing, no one is actively waiting for a response, and batching of work is common. There may also be multiple stages of processing.

For each stage, track the items coming in, how many are in progress, the last time you processed something, and how many items were sent out. If batching, you should also track batches going in and out.

Knowing the last time that a system processed something is useful for detecting if it has stalled, but it is very localised information. A better approach is to send a heartbeat through the system: some dummy item that gets passed all the way through and includes the timestamp when it was inserted. Each stage can export the most recent heartbeat timestamp it has seen, letting you know how long items are taking to propagate through the system.

### Batch jobs

There is a fuzzy line between offline-processing and batch jobs, as offline processing may be done in batch jobs. Batch jobs are distinguished by the fact that they do not run continuously, which makes scraping them difficult.

The key metric of a batch job is the last time it succeeded. It is also useful to track how long each major stage of the job took, the overall runtime and the last time the job completed (successful or failed).

## Writing Exporters

To quote the prometheus website, "The main decision you need to make when writing an exporter is how much work youâ€™re willing to put in to get perfect metrics out of it."
